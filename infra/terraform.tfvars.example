# Example Terraform Variables Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your values

# AWS Configuration
aws_region = "us-east-1"

# Project Configuration
project_name = "langgraph"
environment  = "production"

# VPC Configuration
vpc_cidr           = "10.0.0.0/16"
availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]

# ECS Configuration
ecs_task_cpu    = 512  # 0.5 vCPU
ecs_task_memory = 1024 # 1 GB

# Service Scaling
ecs_desired_count = 1  # Number of tasks to run
ecs_min_capacity  = 1  # Minimum tasks for auto-scaling
ecs_max_capacity  = 4  # Maximum tasks for auto-scaling
ecs_cpu_target    = 70 # Target CPU % for auto-scaling

# Application Configuration
container_port = 8010
app_image_tag  = "latest"

# ALB Configuration
alb_idle_timeout = 300 # 5 minutes (important for WebSocket)

# Secrets Configuration
# DO NOT set API keys here! Instead, set them in Terraform Cloud as sensitive Terraform variables:
# 1. Go to Terraform Cloud workspace → Variables
# 2. Add these as Terraform variables (NOT environment variables), marked as sensitive:
#    - llama_api_key = "your-actual-llama-api-key"
#    - steel_api_key = "your-actual-steel-api-key"
#    - serpapi_key = "your-actual-serpapi-key"

# Vercel Integration
# Get project ID from: Vercel → Project Settings → General
# Get team ID from: Vercel → Team Settings (if using team projects)
vercel_project_id = "prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"  # Replace with your project ID
vercel_team_id    = null                         # Or "team_xxxxx" if using teams
